Instructions to run:
1. Ensure you have cmake version at least >= 3.26
2. Ensure you have the latest g++ version (I test on 10.2.1)
3. Once you have the repository checked out, run ‘cmake -S src -B build’ from TOPDIR. This generates the build tree. Only need to run once, for the first you are using the repo.
4. Build : cmake --build build --target Cubist -j 6
5. Run : build/Cubist -X 0.5 -Y 0.5 -i cpp_project -o output_dir.
6. That’s it!
